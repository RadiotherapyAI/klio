Direct runner on GKE
--------------------

Klio can now be run on the additional runner of DirectGKERunner.

Under the hood, when using the new DirectGKERunner with a Klio job, Klio creates a GKE deployment. When GKE starts the containers for the deployment, it runs the Klio job in DirectRunner mode (just like you would locally with ``klio job run --direct-runner``.

The difference between ``DirectGKERunner`` and ``DirectRunner`` is that the latter automatically acknowledges messages it reads from the Pub/Sub queue before running it through the defined pipeline. This logic has been adapted on DirectGKERunner to acknowledge the message once itâ€™s considered done running through the pipeline (i.e. either it successfully completed the pipeline, was filtered out, or was dropped due to an error in processing). Without this ability, if a container gets OOM-killed or the job gets otherwise interrupted, then the failing or in-progress messages do not return to the Pub/Sub queue for re-delivery. Those messages would be lost.

Using the ``DirectGKERunner`` for a Klio job comes with inherent limitations:

* The Klio job must:
    * be a streaming job (and therefore read event input from a Pub/Sub subscription or topic)
    * not need any aggregation transforms (e.g. ``GroupByKey``, ``CombinePerKey``, ``Distinct``, etc). ``Reshuffle`` & ``Flatten`` are also not supported.
    * not process non-KlioMessages (``klio-job.yaml::job_config.allow_non_klio_messages``)
    * be deployed manually (i.e. via ``klio job run [OPTIONS]``).

* Observability

Logs can be viewed via **kubectl** [#f0]_ commands.
Klio now supports configuration fields to enable the use of **shumway** [#f1]_, a library for sending metrics to a **FFWD** [#f2]_ agent.


Metrics
-------

Default metrics [#f3]_ have been added for the following transform classes, with the name of the metric in parens:

* IO transforms:
    * ``KlioReadFromText`` (kmsg-read)
    * ``KlioReadFromBigQuery`` (kmsg-read)
    * ``KlioReadFromAvro`` (kmsg-read)
    * ``KlioWriteToText`` (kmsg-write)
    * ``KlioWriteToBigQuery`` (kmsg-write)
    * ``KlioWriteToAvro`` (kmsg-write)
    * ``KlioReadFromPubSub`` (kmsg-read)
    * ``KlioWriteToPubSub`` (kmsg-write)
* Helper Transforms:
    * ``KlioGcsCheckInputExists`` (kmsg-data-found-input, kmsg-data-not-found-input)
    * ``KlioGcsCheckOutputExists`` (kmsg-data-found-output, kmsg-data-not-found-output)
    * ``KlioFilterPing`` (kmsg-process-ping, kmsg-skip-ping)
    * ``KlioFilterForce`` (kmsg-process-force, kmsg-skip-force)
    * ``KlioWriteToEventOutput`` (kmsg-output)
    * ``KlioDrop`` (kmsg-drop)
    * ``KlioCheckRecipients`` (kmsg-drop-not-recipient)
    * ``KlioDebugMessage`` (kmsg-debug)
    * ``KlioTriggerUpstream`` (kmsg-trigger-upstream)
* Decorators:
    * ``@retry`` (kmsg-retry-attempt, kmsg-drop-retry-error)
    * ``@timeout`` (kmsg-drop-timed-out)
    * ``@handle_klio`` (counters: kmsg-received, kmsg-drop-error, kmsg-success; timer: kmsg-timer)
    * ``@serialize_klio_message`` (same metrics as @handle_klio`)

These metrics also show up in Stackdriver monitoring when configured to use Stackdriver and are available to select in Metrics Explorer when building a dashboard.

A user-facing metrics interface for shumway [#f1]_ has been added for when log-based metrics is not feasible.
